## Python Lists start at 1 Class
Small challenge that I did to make lists start at index 1. Its a brand new class, not inherited, with some other basic list things built in.


## Email Regex
This small script when run will check for all instances of an email address in the text you copy and paste into the input.txt and make list of them in the output.txt. It will include a datetime stamp in the output of when the script was run.
WARNING : This script clears the input.txt file when run.
